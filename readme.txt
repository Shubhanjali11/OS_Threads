FOR COMPILATION:- make

TO RUN THE FILE:- ./exe

STRUCTURE OF PROGRAM:- It is a program that takes no of complex number from the user and also the value of number to create as many threads then display the result of multiplication of the elements of array.

TASKS COMPLETED:- 1.The program computes multiplication of the elements of array.

TASKS NOT COMPLETED:- 1.The program does not take input from file due to some error.
		      2.In the program, the main thread is not reported to by the intermediate threads.
		      3.After the first level the threads do not function properly.
